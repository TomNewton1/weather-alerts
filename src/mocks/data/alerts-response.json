Flooding of rivers, creeks, ditches, and\npoor drainage areas is possible across portions of northeastern\nIllinois and northwestern Indiana late Friday into Saturday. River\nrises and flooding may also occur along the Iroquois, Kankakee, and\nIllinois rivers.\n\nPeriods of showers and thunderstorms will move through the region\nlate Friday into Saturday. Swaths of rainfall amounts up to 1-2\ninches may occur, generally southeast of I-55. Localized amounts in\nexcess of 2 inches are possible, especially closer to west central\nIndiana and east central Illinois.\n\nHigh soil moisture and elevated river levels from recent rainfall\nmay increase runoff and the chance that rivers near or exceed flood\nstage due to additional rainfall. Flooding of yards, fields, and\nother poor drainage areas may also occur. The northwestern edge of\nthe heavy rainfall is expected to have a sharp gradient, with\nrelatively light rainfall amounts near heavier rainfall amounts.\nThus, small shifts in the forecasted track of this swath of heavy\nrainfall could mean significant differences in river crests and the\nprobability of flooding.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts\nare possible, but not yet certain. Persons should closely monitor\nforecasts including the possibility of flood watches, warnings, and\nadvisories.\n\nThe next scheduled update to this outlook is tomorrow morning.",

Action stage is the level which some type of mitigation\nis needed in preparation for possible minor flooding. At this time,\nSalmon Falls Creek is not anticipated to reach minor flood stage\n(10.0 feet).\n\nResidents and outdoor enthusiasts are urged to exercise caution when\nwalking near rapidly flowing, cold water.
